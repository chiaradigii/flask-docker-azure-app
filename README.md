# Repository Description
## Description:
This repository contains a Python Flask web application configured for containerization using Docker. It includes infrastructure deployment to Azure using GitHub workflows, leveraging Azure Containers technology and BICEP for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The project demonstrates:

* Local development, configuration, and debugging of a Python application in Docker containers.
* Deployment of infrastructure to Azure via GitHub workflows using BICEP.
* Deployment of the application to Azure using GitHub workflows.
* Secure credentials management using Azure Key Vault secrets.
  
This setup aims to provide a robust framework for developing, deploying, and managing a containerized Flask application in a cloud environment.
